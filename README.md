# STATISTICAL-LEARNING-AN-AI-PROJECT

This repository consists of two projects:
Linear regression vs. nonLinear regression, and k-means vs Hierarchical clustering

I used the boston price dataset from kaggle to instigate the performance between linear and nonLinear regression models

For the clustering project, I used the mall dataset from kaggle as well, to see which of the two models performed better in clustering the customer profiles.
I used R for both projects.
